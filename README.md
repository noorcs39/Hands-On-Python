# Practical Python Exercises: Enhancing Programming Proficiency through Hands-On Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the **Hands-On-Python** repository! This collection is designed to provide a strong foundation in Python programming, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced applications. These exercises were developed during my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Sukkur IBA University, where I gained comprehensive knowledge in various programming languages, including Python, and worked on impactful projects like a **Sign Language Interpreter for Mute People**.

## About Me

I'm a Computer Science graduate from Sukkur IBA University, where I specialized in core computing concepts, advanced technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI). My academic journey equipped me with the skills needed for software development, systems design, and AI, preparing me for diverse roles in the technology industry.
